        <h1>More Information</h1>
        <h2>The origin of Hiragana</h2> 
        <img src="characterevolve.jpg" alt="evolution of wa and ku" id="characterevolve">
        <p>Hiragana is a Kana system which means that it is a system that represents Japanese sounds. There are currently only two Kana 
            systems that are used today, however four Kana systems have been used throughout history. These are: Manyogana, Hentaigana, 
            Hiragana and Katakana. Japan got its first writing system in the 5th century when it was introduced to Chinese characters. 
            Japan used the Chinese characters to represent the meaning of Japanese words, which was the creation of Kanji. The reason that 
            Kanji is not a Kana system is because each Kanji character represents a meaning rather than a sound. The first Kana system: Manyogana
            emerged from Kanji. Manyogana was made by changing the way that Kanji was used. Instead of using the Kanji to represent a meaning,
            Manyogana used the Kanji for its sounds. From Manyogana came Sogana which was written in a more cursive scipt. Sogana also simplified
            the original Manyogana characters. Sogana was quickly developed into Hiragana by undergoing further simplification during the 9th century 
            and Hiragana has been used as the Kana system for Japanese words ever since.

        <h3>Missing characters</h3>
         <img src="missingcharacters.jpg" alt="missingcharacters" id="missingcharacters">
        <p>As you may have noticed, there are five empty spaces within the Hiragana chart, located in the Y and W rows. 
            You may wonder what happened to Yi, Ye, Wi, Wu and We. Well, the sounds Yi and Wu were actually never used in Japanese 
            pronunciation and so never had a place in any Kana system. Ye was a Japanese sound that was included when Japan created 
            its first Kana system: Manyogana. The Manyogana character that represented the Ye sound was 江. However, 江 never made it 
            into Hiragana and the reason for this is that the sound Ye gradually began to sound the same as the sound E. Due to this,
            Ye was left behind when Hiragana was created although the modern-day Katakana E is derived from the original Manyogana Ye.
            See how the right side of 江 became the character エ? The sounds Wi and We were originally part of Hiragana with the 
            characters being ゐ for Wi and ゑ for We. They were officially removed from Hiragana in 1946 as they were seen as unnecessary.
            This is because in speech their pronunciation became too similar to the vowel sounds I and E. However, you may still come 
            across ゐ and ゑ as they are sometimes used in character names and names of brands that were made before 1946.
